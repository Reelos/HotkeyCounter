# HotkeyCounter
Just a little side project of a Counter, for keeping track of things.

##Basic Functions
| Key | Function |
|:---:| -------- |
| Space | Increments the counter |
| Backspace | Decrements the counter |
| Ctrl + R | Resets the counter |
| Ctrl + P | Opens a Dialog to Choose a Picture, <br>to determinate what the counter is for |
| Ctrl + X | Closes the Counter |
| Ctrl + S | Opens a Window to set the Counter to a certain number |

##Restrictions
Since this is a Java Program the Counter MUST have Focus when you start to count. 
There is Just no easy way to make a global hotkey in Java.

##TODO
    Make it Draggable
    Make the HotKeys Configurable (except for Ctrl + <any key>)
    ...
